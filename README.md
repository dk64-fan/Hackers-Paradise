# Hackers-Paradise
Overview:
	This script is intended to do funny things with the computer, as well as to provide school students with a way to take more control of their devices.

Instructions:
	The script will require administrator privileges to run. When you run the program, select an option listed on the main menu, and then follow the intructions on screen. Feel free to leave feature requests or report bugs on the Github page.
Credits:
	I wrote most of the code for this script, but others played a huge role in making this happen.
	A few users on Stack Overflow provided useful information on the Batch language in general.
	Several WikiHow guides on Batch gave me the information I needed.
	A huge thanks to johnsoupir (https://github.com/johnsoupir) on Github for creating the ASCII Rickroll sequence (I don't have the time to create all that ASCII Art).
	Also, the text to ASCII Art converter at https://patorjk.com/software/taag allowed me to create the Hackers' Paradise Art on the main menu.
